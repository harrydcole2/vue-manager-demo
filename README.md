# Vue Client Manager Project #

This repository was originally created for a job interview, which was using a Vue frontend and a C# backend (with Dapper). They provided a docker-compose file that created a local network so that you could work on the site in your local environment. The original requirements were just to have a dashboard of clients with views of those clients, which I then turned into a full website and I tried to design it to be scalable, especially if I'd need more practice with Vue considering I've always done React. The site provides basic login, has a nice home and help page, and allways users to view their clients whether archived or current and edit phone numbers in that mix. I used Vue Bootstrap components, so it looks pretty similar to comparable sites.

This project was challenging mostly because the environment was outdated, for example it uses dotnet3.1 instead of .NET8, it targets Vue 2, it uses Vuex instead of Pinia, and so on. There were also a few bugs in the original code to work out such as forgetting to allow any headers in startup.cs and not binding to node-modules in the dockerfile. But those issues aside, it was very insightful to see how a fullstack application works with Vue and how state gets managed. Dapper was also interesting because I've grown accustomed to EF Core, but the general structure was pretty similar.

#### Running the Project ####
* Everything is upped via `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up', which then allows you to navigate or connect to different ports for checking on the running project. There is no registration enabled; instead you'd have to create a user via the API Swagger (both frontend and backend are not secured) or use the seeded user: test@testing.com with pwd test. You could also manually set the user data in local storage, but that is not recommended.
* Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build` to rebuild and then `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up` again in order to see your updates on the backend. Hot reloading should be implemented on the frontend, which you can track in docker output.
* The database is created and seeded on the Container's initialization, so modifying SQL scripts will require running `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down`, `docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)`, and `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up`. All of your DB data will be removed if you do this.
* You'll notice on the backend there are endpoints and tables/repos that go unused regarding Registration, Products, and Orders. These artifacts of the backend would be useful if we scaled up the app to connect user data with an associated order history.
